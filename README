This is a set of lecture notes on mathematical methods for
economics suitable for postgraduate and doctoral students.
The initial goal is to cover the same topics as Simon &
Blume but at a slightly more sophisticated level so that
students can go on to study more mathematical texts in
optimization theory.

It is also an experiment in collaborative textbook
development. I eagerly look forward to contributors.
